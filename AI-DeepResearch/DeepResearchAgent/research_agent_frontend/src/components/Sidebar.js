import { FiPlus, FiHome, FiCompass, FiStar, FiUser } from 'react-icons/fi'; // Example icons

//Thought Process:
//Component Identification: The left bar is a distinct, self-contained UI element.
//Props: Currently, it doesn't take props, but it could if, for example, the list of navigation items was dynamic or if the user icon needed to change based on login status.
//Styling: Sidebar.css handles its fixed width, background color, and internal arrangement of elements (again, often using flexbox for vertical stacking and spacing of its children).
//Icons: Used react-icons for visual cues, making the UI more intuitive.
//How it Evolves:
//Dynamic Content: Navigation links could be fetched from an API or be based on user roles.
//Statefulness: The "New Thread" button might trigger an action that changes state elsewhere in the app. The active navigation link would likely be managed by state (possibly through a routing library).
//Collapsibility: The sidebar might become collapsible, requiring state to manage its open/closed status and more complex CSS for animations.
