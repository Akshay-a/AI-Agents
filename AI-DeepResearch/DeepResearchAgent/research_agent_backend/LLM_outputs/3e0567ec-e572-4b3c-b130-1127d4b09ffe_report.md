### Core Concepts
Bitcoin is a digital currency designed to operate without central authorities, relying instead on a peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions (Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/4-key-concepts-of-bitcoin/). The core concepts of Bitcoin include:
*   **Disintermediation:** Transactions occur directly between users without intermediaries like banks (Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/4-key-concepts-of-bitcoin/).
*   **Decentralization:** There is no central control or single point of failure (Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/4-key-concepts-of-bitcoin/).
*   **Distributed Ledger:** Bitcoin relies on a public, distributed ledger called a blockchain, which records all transactions chronologically and immutably (Source: https://www.blockpit.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin).
*   **Trustless System:** The blockchain and cryptography allow transactions to be verified without the need for a trusted third party (Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/4-key-concepts-of-bitcoin/).
*   **Proof-of-Work:** Transactions are validated by miners who solve complex computational problems, securing the network and adding new blocks to the blockchain (Source: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin).

The Bitcoin network is completely public and open-source, enabling anyone with an internet connection to participate without restrictions (Source: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin).

### History and Evolution
Bitcoin was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” on October 31, 2008 (Source: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin). The first block, the genesis block, was mined on January 3, 2009, with the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” embedded in the genesis block (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin). The first transaction occurred on January 12, 2009, when Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin).
